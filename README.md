# TRAFFIC	LIGHT	WITH	COUNTER
This code controls a 7-segment display and LEDs using direct AVR register programming.
PORTD and PORTB pins are configured as outputs to display numbers from 9 to 0 in a countdown sequence.
Different LED states are triggered based on the current count value, creating visual warnings at specific numbers.
Timing is managed with delay functions to ensure each digit and LED state is shown clearly.
